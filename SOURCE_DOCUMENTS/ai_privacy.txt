AI Privacy and Local Computing

In an era of increasing data privacy concerns, running AI models locally
has become increasingly important for individuals and organizations.

Benefits of Local AI:
- Data Privacy: Your documents never leave your device
- No Internet Required: Works completely offline
- No Subscriptions: One-time setup, no recurring costs
- Full Control: You control the model and data processing

Challenges:
- Hardware Requirements: Needs sufficient RAM and processing power
- Model Downloads: Initial setup requires downloading large models
- Technical Setup: More complex than cloud-based solutions

The Mac M4 with its unified memory architecture and Metal Performance Shaders
provides an excellent platform for local AI processing, offering the perfect
balance of performance, efficiency, and privacy.

Security Considerations:
- Models run in isolation
- No network access required during inference
- Local storage of all data and embeddings
- Full control over data retention and deletion
